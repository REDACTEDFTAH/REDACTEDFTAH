    <pre>I see you have cracked the code.
My name is <b><i>Haxabja</i></b>, and you found my secret.
For years, this data file has been hidden to the public.
But I released it, thinking it was something ordinary.
Yet out of horror, I saw something I shouldnt have seen....
The "<i>Byq QNGn</i>".
You cracked the many <b id="I WAS THE FIRST">LAYERS OF DEFENSE</b> I built..
The knowledge is yours..
However keep in mind, do not share this to anyone at <b id="THEY BROKE THE PACT">ALL</b></pre>
